# Setting up Agda and Coq with Emacs

This repository contains my instructions on installing/setting up the
latest versions of Agda and Coq.  I've also created a convenient
(apart from its size) docker image, which you can use to just try
everything out without installing anything (assuming you have docker
already installed).

# Installing by hand

- [Install Agda](install-agda.md)
- [Install Coq](install-coq.md)
- [Set up Emacs](setup-emacs.md)

# Use Docker

```
docker pull klao/agda-coq
```
